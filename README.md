Flask User API

A simple REST API built with Flask for managing user data with CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a basic REST API using Python and Flask. It allows storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting user information.
Data is stored in memory (dictionary) for learning and testing purposes â€” meaning all data resets when the server restarts.

ðŸ›  Tools Used

Python â€” Programming language

Flask â€” Web framework for API creation

VS Code â€” Code editor

REST Client extension (optional) â€” To test API requests inside VS Code

cURL/Postman â€” Alternative tools for testing API

ðŸš€ Features

GET /users â€” Retrieve all users

GET /users/<id> â€” Retrieve a specific user by ID

POST /users â€” Add a new user

PUT /users/<id> â€” Update an existing user

DELETE /users/<id> â€” Delete a user

âš™ Installation & Running

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-user-api.git


Navigate to project folder

cd flask-user-api


Install dependencies

pip install flask


Run the Flask server

python app.py


Server runs at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

ðŸ§ª Testing the API
Using VS Code REST Client

Install the REST Client extension in VS Code.

Open api_test.http.

Click "Send Request" above the request you want to run.

Using cURL

Example commands:

Add User

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/users \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"Alice","email":"alice@example.com"}'


Get All Users

curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/users


Get User by ID

curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/1


Update User

curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/1 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email":"alice_new@example.com"}'


Delete User

curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/1

{
  "1": {
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com"
  }
}
